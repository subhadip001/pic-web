    I would like to complement and congratulate our industry partners for being steady and consistent in their partnership with us notwithstanding the turbulence caused by Covid-19. It is also pertinent to point out the exemplary attitude shown by our recent graduates to address the contingency arising out of the pandemic.

    In the past, students recruited from IIT Roorkee have proved to be valuable assets for the companies they have joined. I am certain that despite the adverse conditions created by the ongoing pandemic, our present batch of graduates would maintain the same level of high standards and prove themselves worthy of the companies they will join.
    
    I wish the upcoming placement program a great success and look forward to establishing relationships with new recruiters of our graduates while also strengthening the current partnerships. Together we can make a difference towards rejuvenating the Indian economy in the post Covid era.`
